## GET STARTED

To run this program, first download this directory.  

Navigate to it in terminal, then type:  

    make

then:
 
    ./gameoflife

## RULES

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

## TESTING

You can put in a textfile, like myinput.txt, to run the program with different data.
